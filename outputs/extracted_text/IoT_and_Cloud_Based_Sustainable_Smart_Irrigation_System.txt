Abstract. This paper addresses the concerns in irrigation 
mechanisms and employs a Sensors and cloud-based platform to 
monitor and control an irrigation system. In order to monitor the 
soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are placed in the 
field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, 
which processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU 
gathers the sensor data and processes it, considering standard 
deviations and crop-specific parameters. Using this information, 
the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves to 
begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with 
these valve-opening devices via wireless communication. In 
addition, the system uses online weather prediction data to provide 
more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system 
dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of 
weather patterns, evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to 
save water during times of rain or high humidity. The solution 
makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability and 
accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions 
are safely transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to 
remotely check on and adjust the irrigation system by means of the 
web or mobile apps. In addition, data analytics methods may be 
used to infer information and provide suggestions for improved methods of water management and crop care. In conclusion, the 
Internet of Things (IoT) NodeMCU smart irrigation system 
provides an automated and intelligent approach to water 
management in agriculture. Water is saved, crop yields are 
boosted, and sustainability is enhanced 
thanks to the capacity to 
irrigate precisely based on real-time soil moisture data, weather 
predictions, and crop needs.

1. Overview  
 
 
1.1 Introduction  
A smart irrigation system that makes use of the Internet of Things is a cutting-edge piece of 
technology that facilitates effective water management in rural and urban settings. Multiple sensors are included in the system to monitor local weather and air quality. When this 
information is collected, it is sent to a cloud service where machine learning algorithms may 
be used. The study informs the system's decision to either 
increase or decrease the water flow 
rate or the irrigation schedule, respectively, to  maximize efficiency and minimize waste. 
Incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into smart irrigation systems may boost 
agricultural output, cut water usage, and optimize water use [4].  
An automated method of watering plants or crops, a smart irrigation system utilizes Internet 
of Things (IoT) technology to monitor and adjust water use. It integrates sensing, controlling, 
and networking technologies to monitor things like soil moisture, climate, and plant 
requirements in real-time [5]. The system may then use this information to make calculated 
judgments about when and how much water to release, resulting in the more effective use of 
available water resources and less waste.  
Improvements in technology in recent years have allowed novel approaches in several arenas. 
As IoT development has accelerated, so have the opportunities for automating hitherto 
inaccessible facets of human life. An example is the smart irrigation system, which uses 
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for precise management and control of watering plants and 
crops [6]. The inefficiency and wastefulness of conventional irrigation techniques are well-
documented. However, a smart irrigation system can track and adjust water distribution in 
response to real-time data collected through the Internet of Things and sensors. This not only 
improves plant health and crop yields by minimizing wasteful water use, but it also maximizes 
efficiency by delivering water precisely when it is needed [7].  
IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems provide a cutting-edge answer to the traditional problems 
farmers have always had with water management. These systems optimize water use, preserve 
resources, and boost agricultural output by combining sensor data, meteorological 
information, and sophisticated control algorithms [8,9]. As science and engineering progress, 
smart irrigation systems will become more important in promoting ecologically responsible 
agricultural methods. 
1.2 Objective  
Using Internet of Things (IoT) technology and data-driven decision-making, a smart irrigation 
system seeks to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of the irrigation process. The primary 
goals of an intelligent irrigation system are as follows:  
The fundamental goal of a smart irrigation system is water conservation via efficient use. 
Technology is able to minimize overwatering and reduce water waste by keeping track of 
environmental conditions, soil moisture levels, and plant water needs and delivering water 
only when and where it is required. 
 
 
 
 Smart irrigation systems try to fully mechanism the watering process so that no human 
assistance is required at any point. The system may gather data, do analysis, and initiate 
irrigation events according to user-defined thresholds and algorithms by using sensors, actuators, 
and Internet of Things connection. This technology makes it easier for farmers and gardeners to control irrigation [10].
 
The purpose of an intelligent irrigation system is to provide the best possible development and 
health of the plants. The technology aids in preventing plant stress, illness, and decreased 
production due to under- or over-watering by delivering the appropriate quantity of water at the 
appropriate time. Plants and harvests benefit from consistent, ideal soil moisture levels.  
By targeting the root zone specifically, as smart irrigation systems do, we may achieve what is known as "precision watering." The system may adjust the frequency and duration of watering 
based on the soil moisture and plant water demands data it receives from sensors. This kind of 
precise irrigation reduces wasteful runoff while increasing the amount of water that is absorbed 
by plants [11].
 
The ability to remotely monitor and adjust the irrigation system is another desired outcome of a "smart" irrigation system. Users may access real-time data, get messages and warnings, and 
make remote adjustments to irrigation settings [12] by linking with cloud platforms and mobile 
apps. The ability to control the irrigation system from afar allows for more ease and mobility.
 
Smart irrigation systems are also concerned with minimizing power use. Sensor data and smart 
algorithms allow the system to activate water pumps, valves, and irrigation systems just when 
they are needed, drastically cutting down on energy costs. This goal is consistent with eco-
friendly methods and savings for the end user.  
1.3 Motivation  
Water supplies are under severe strain due to the increased need for food production to meet the 
needs of a rising global population. More effective and long-lasting irrigation methods are 
required since water shortage is becoming a serious problem in the agricultural sector. 
 Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart irrigation systems might be the answer to this problem 
[13]. These systems enhance water efficiency and agricultural productivity by monitoring and 
optimizing water consumption in crops via the use of sensors, communication networks, and 
algorithms. Using the Internet of Things to create a smart irrigation system might help farmers 
save water, enhance output, and save expenses [14]. Therefore, it is essential to maintain 
research and development on these systems to guarantee agricultural and food production's 
long-term viability. 
Improving agricultural and landscape water management is a primary motivator for adopting 
Internet of Things (IoT) based smart irrigation systems [15]. Wasted water, higher utility bills, 
and environmental problems are all consequences of traditional irrigation practices. Several 
advantages may be gained by using IoT in irrigation systems.  
Firstly, water savings via the use of sensors, meteorological data, and soil moisture sensors to 
ascertain the precise amount of water that each plant needs. This data is used in the automation 
of irrigation programs to ensure that just the required quantity of water is applied at the 
appropriate times.  
Second, smart irrigation systems assist in saving money by reducing water costs by 
maximizing efficiency in water use. IoT-based solutions save money on labor since they can 
automate scheduling and monitoring functions.

Thirdly, water conservation is a key aspect of smart irrigation systems' impact on 
environmental sustainability [16]. Efficient irrigation practices assist in alleviating the problem 
of water shortage, which is a serious issue in many areas. Water conservation also lessens the 
strain on regional ecologies and cuts down on the amount of power needed to pump and treat 
water. 
The fourth point is that sensors enabled by the Internet of Things provide real-time information 
on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions, enhancing plant health and production. Using this information, farmers can fine-tune their watering schedules 
and give their plants just what they need to flourish. If you want healthier plants and higher 
yields from your crops, you need to prevent overwatering and underwatering.
 
Fifth, IoT-based smart irrigation systems allow for remote monitoring and control through 
mobile apps or online interfaces. This allows farmers and gardeners the freedom and 
convenience of remotely monitoring and controlling their irrigation systems [17]. They can 
fine-tune the system, be notified of any problems, and base their judgment on accurate, up-to-the-moment information.
 
Insights gleaned from data: Smart irrigation systems record information about water use, soil 
quality, and other environmental parameters. This information may be used for a variety of 
purposes, including but not limited to pattern recognition, irrigation strategy improvement, and 
water demand forecasting [18]. This data gives farmers and landscapers the ability to make 
better choices, allocate resources more effectively, and increase productivity. The goal of an 
Internet of Things (IoT)- enabled smart irrigation system is to increase plant health and 
production while simultaneously decreasing water use and operating expenses.  
 
1.4 Literature Survey  
 
[1] Kavitha and Kumar's (2020) research on Smart irrigation systems using IoT Technology 
examined the process of creating such a system. The technology used soil moisture sensors, 
which sent measurements of soil moisture to a server in the cloud. After compiling the 
information, the system advised users on when to water, how much water to apply, and for how 
long. A preliminary analysis of the system's efficacy suggests it may save as much as 40% of 
water while maintaining the same level of crop output.  
[2] Soil moisture levels and irrigation schedules may be predicted with the use of a smart 
irrigation system, as presented by Li et al. (2021) in their work titled "Smart irrigation system 
using IoT and Machine Learning Algorithms". The system integrated information from several 
channels to provide reliable forecasts, such as meteorological models, ground sensors, and 
satellite imaging. According to the research, the technology may increase crop output by up to 
30% while cutting water use by up to 50%.  
Zaman et al.'s (2020) review paper "Smart irrigation system" presented an overview  of many types 
of smart irrigation systems and their components (see [3]). Soil moisture sensors and weather 
sensors were two examples of the sorts of sensors described in this article (see also [3]). 
Controllers like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and Micro-controllers, used for 
automating irrigation, were also covered. According to the article's findings, smart irrigation 
systems might significantly enhance agriculture's efficiency in its water-use practices [19]. It 
has been shown that smart irrigation systems may significantly cut water use without 
negatively impacting crop output. Depending on the soil's moisture content, the weather 
forecast, and the rate at which plants are growing, these systems may adjust the amount of water 
they consume to get the best possible results. For these technologies to be extensively 
implemented in agriculture, additional study is required to develop them. 
 
 
  
 
2. Implementation  
Hardware components for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing watering are essential in an 
Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart irrigation system. A NodeMCU, a DHT11 sensor, and soil 
moisture sensors are the brains of a smart irrigation system. The monitoring of environmental 
conditions, analysis of data, intelligent judgements, and automation of the watering process are 
all possible thanks to the hardware components that make up a smart irrigation system. Effective 
water management made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT) enables optimal plant 
development, less water waste, and increased sustainability in agricultural practices. 
 
2.1 Block Diagram  
A smart irrigation system that makes use of the Internet of Things comprises of hardware 
components that combine to gather data, analyze that data, and then regulate the irrigation 
process in real time. Together, the Internet of Things and other pieces of hardware allow for better water management, higher agricultural yields, and environmentally friendly farming.

distribution rates.

Communication Network: The communication network is what allows information to flow 
from sensors to the IoT gateway to the cloud or control system. Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and 
other wireless communication protocols are only some of the technologies it may use to 
guarantee a constant connection.  
User Interface (Blynk Application): The smart irrigation system's user interface allows for 
human interaction with the system. A dashboard, smartphone app, or online interface may all 
be used to manage and monitor an irrigation system in real-time. Users may see sensor data, 
set up watering schedules, and make fine-tuned modifications.  
Actuators (Motor Driver): The component is the actuators (motor drivers), which are in 
charge of operating the irrigation machinery in response to commands from the cloud or 
control system [21]. Based on the results of the analysis, they may trigger valves, pumps, sprinklers, or drip irrigation systems to water the plants as needed.
 
Power Supply: The sensors, IoT gateway, communication devices, and actuators in a smart 
irrigation system can't function without a reliable power source. This can be achieved through a combination of mains power, batteries, solar panels, or other renewable energy sources.
 
Overall, the block diagram of a smart irrigation system using IoT illustrates the flow of data and 
control between the sensors in the field, the IoT gateway, the cloud or control system, the 
communication network, the user interface, and the actuators. This interconnected system 
enables real-time monitoring, data analysis, and intelligent irrigation management for efficient 
water usage and sustainable agriculture practice.  
 
2.2 Schematic Diagram  
 
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of the System 
 
The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Figure 2. A smart irrigation system using 
IoT (Internet of Things) typically consists of several components and sensors working 
together to efficiently manage and automate the process of watering plants or crops. Here's a 
description of a typical schematic diagram for such a system: 
Water Source: The system begins with a water source, such as a well, municipal water supply, 
or rainwater harvesting system. This source provides the water required for irrigation.  
 
 
  
Water Pump: A water pump is used to draw water from the source and provide the necessary 
pressure for distribution throughout the irrigation system. A motor or solenoid valve is 
usually used to operate it.  
Soil Moisture Sensor: This sensor is embedded in the soil and measures the moisture content. 
It helps determine if irrigation is required or not. 
DHT11 Sensor: The DHT11 sensor is a data logger that records environmental conditions. 
This data is utilized to make climate-appropriate adjustments to the watering schedule.  
Microcontroller/Control Unit: The system's central processing unit (CPU) is a 
microcontroller such an Arduino, NodeMCU, or Raspberry Pi. It takes sensor input, processes it, and then uses that information to command the system's different parts. In most 
cases, the microcontroller will need to be online to communicate information with other 
devices.
 
IoT Gateway: The IoT gateway enables communication between the microcontroller and the 
cloud server. It may use protocols like Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular networks to connect to the 
internet.  
Cloud Server: The cloud server is responsible for storing and processing the data received 
from the microcontroller. It performs data analytics, weather forecasting, and manages the 
irrigation schedule based on the collected information. It also enables remote access and 
control of the irrigation system.  
User Interface: The user interface can be a web or mobile application that allows the user to 
monitor and control the irrigation system remotely. It provides real-time data, historical 
analysis, and the ability to adjust settings and irrigation schedules.  
Solenoid Valves: These valves control the flow of water to different irrigation zones. The 
microcontroller activates or deactivates the valves based on the desired irrigation schedule 
and sensor inputs.  
Drip/Sprinkler System: The irrigation system may consist of drip lines or sprinklers 
strategically placed in the field or garden to distribute water evenly to the plants.  
Overall, this schematic diagram demonstrates the integration of sensors, microcontrollers, 
IoT connectivity, cloud servers, and user interfaces to create a smart irrigation system. The 
system aims to optimize water usage, reduce manual intervention, and ensure efficient 
irrigation based on real-time data and environmental factors. 
2.3 Working  
The Soil Moisture sensor (YL-69) is inserted into the soil which senses the moisture level of 
the soil. The DHT11 sensor senses the surrounding humidity and temperature. The Motor 
Driver (L298N) controls the water pump. The above-mentioned components are connected to 
the NodeMCU which is a microcontroller unit. This NodeMCU is connected to the cloud 
environment to store the data. An app is developed which helps in controlling and monitoring the 
respective parameter values of moisture, temperature, and humidity. Based on the soil moisture level the pump turns ON or OFF automatically. These parameters are finally displayed in a 
dashboard on the device screen.

control system [21]. Based on the results of the analysis, they may trigger valves, pumps, sprinklers, or drip irrigation systems to water the plants as needed.
 
Power Supply: The sensors, IoT gateway, communication devices, and actuators in a smart 
irrigation system can't function without a reliable power source. This can be achieved through a combination of mains power, batteries, solar panels, or other renewable energy sources.
 
Overall, the block diagram of a smart irrigation system using IoT illustrates the flow of data and 
control between the sensors in the field, the IoT gateway, the cloud or control system, the 
communication network, the user interface, and the actuators. This interconnected system 
enables real-time monitoring, data analysis, and intelligent irrigation management for efficient 
water usage and sustainable agriculture practice.  
 
2.2 Schematic Diagram  
 
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of the System 
 
The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Figure 2. A smart irrigation system using 
IoT (Internet of Things) typically consists of several components and sensors working 
together to efficiently manage and automate the process of watering plants or crops. Here's a 
description of a typical schematic diagram for such a system: 
Water Source: The system begins with a water source, such as a well, municipal water supply, 
or rainwater harvesting system. This source provides the water required for irrigation.  
 
 
  
Water Pump: A water pump is used to draw water from the source and provide the necessary 
pressure for distribution throughout the irrigation system. A motor or solenoid valve is 
usually used to operate it.  
Soil Moisture Sensor: This sensor is embedded in the soil and measures the moisture content. 
It helps determine if irrigation is required or not. 
DHT11 Sensor: The DHT11 sensor is a data logger that records environmental conditions. 
This data is utilized to make climate-appropriate adjustments to the watering schedule.  
Microcontroller/Control Unit: The system's central processing unit (CPU) is a 
microcontroller such an Arduino, NodeMCU, or Raspberry Pi. It takes sensor input, processes it, and then uses that information to command the system's different parts. In most 
cases, the microcontroller will need to be online to communicate information with other 
devices.
 
IoT Gateway: The IoT gateway enables communication between the microcontroller and the 
cloud server. It may use protocols like Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular networks to connect to the 
internet.  
Cloud Server: The cloud server is responsible for storing and processing the data received 
from the microcontroller. It performs data analytics, weather forecasting, and manages the 
irrigation schedule based on the collected information. It also enables remote access and 
control of the irrigation system.  
User Interface: The user interface can be a web or mobile application that allows the user to 
monitor and control the irrigation system remotely. It provides real-time data, historical 
analysis, and the ability to adjust settings and irrigation schedules.  
Solenoid Valves: These valves control the flow of water to different irrigation zones. The 
microcontroller activates or deactivates the valves based on the desired irrigation schedule 
and sensor inputs.  
Drip/Sprinkler System: The irrigation system may consist of drip lines or sprinklers 
strategically placed in the field or garden to distribute water evenly to the plants.  
Overall, this schematic diagram demonstrates the integration of sensors, microcontrollers, 
IoT connectivity, cloud servers, and user interfaces to create a smart irrigation system. The 
system aims to optimize water usage, reduce manual intervention, and ensure efficient 
irrigation based on real-time data and environmental factors. 
2.3 Working  
The Soil Moisture sensor (YL-69) is inserted into the soil which senses the moisture level of 
the soil. The DHT11 sensor senses the surrounding humidity and temperature. The Motor 
Driver (L298N) controls the water pump. The above-mentioned components are connected to 
the NodeMCU which is a microcontroller unit. This NodeMCU is connected to the cloud 
environment to store the data. An app is developed which helps in controlling and monitoring the 
respective parameter values of moisture, temperature, and humidity. Based on the soil moisture 
level the pump turns ON or OFF automatically. These parameters are finally displayed in a 
dashboard on the device screen.

Figure 3 shows the flowchart of the system. The module is turned on and the Smart Irrigation 
dashboard is opened through the app. The DHT11 and Soil Moisture sensors read the Humidity 
and temperature of the surroundings and the Moisture level of the soil respectively. If the soil 
moisture level is less than the threshold value (50%) then the pump turns ON. If the soil moisture 
level reaches the threshold value, then the pump automatically turns OFF. The respective 
parameter values are displayed on the mobile dashboard. This data is sent over Wi-Fi.

harvests. 
Time efficiency: Automation features of the smart irrigation system eliminate the need for 
manual intervention in irrigation processes. Users can schedule watering routines based on 
plant requirements and environmental factors, and the system will automatically execute the 
irrigation tasks accordingly. This saves time and effort for users, allowing them to focus on 
other important tasks.
