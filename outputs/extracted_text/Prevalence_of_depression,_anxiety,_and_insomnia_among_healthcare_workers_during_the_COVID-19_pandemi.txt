1. Introduction
Lowerrespiratoryinfectionsremainthecommunicablediseasewith
the highest mortality worldwide (Murdoch and Howie, 2018). In De-
cember 2019, a highly infectious serious acute respiratory syndrome
causedbyanovelcoronavirus(SARS-CoV-2)emergedinWuhan,China.
On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 a pandemic(Huanget al., 2020a).
According to previous studies from SARS or Ebola epidemics, the

further compromised by isolation and loss of social support, risk or
infections of friends and relatives as well as drastic, often unsettling
changes in the ways of working. HCWs are, therefore, especially vul-
nerable to mental health problems, including fear, anxiety, depression
andinsomnia (Lung et al., 2009;Wu et al.,2009).
Immediate interventions are essential in order to enhance psycho-

perceived unfamiliarity and uncontrollability of the hazards involved.
Providing timely and appropriately tailored mental health support
through hotline teams, media or multidisciplinary teams, including
mentalhealth professionalsis alsovital (Chenet al., 2020).
Previous reviews have explored the prevalence and factors asso-
ciated with psychological outcomes in HCWs during past infectious
diseaseoutbreaks(Maunderetal.,2004).However,todate,theimpact
of the current unprecedented crisis on the psychological well-being of
medicalandnursingstaffisyettobeestablished.Theaimofthisrapid
systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the emerging evi-
denceoftheeffectsoftheCOVID-19outbreakonthementalhealthof
HCW and particularly in relation to the prevalence of anxiety, depres-
sion andinsomnia.
2. Materialsandmethods
The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the
PRISMA statement (Liberati et al., 2009). The MOOSE (Meta-analyses
OfObservationalStudiesinEpidemiology)Checklistwasfollowed.The
review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online
(CRD42020180313).
2.1. Research strategy and selection criteria
Our search strategy was generated by consensus among all re-
searchers in the group. Two authors independently identified records
published until April 17th 2020 that reported on the prevalence of
depression, anxiety, and insomnia in HCWs during the coronavirus
pandemic through systematically searching MEDLINE, PubMed andGoogleScholardatabases.Moreover,duetotherapiddisseminationof
informationduringthecurrentpandemic,preprintarticlespublishedon
MedrxivandSSRNserverswerealsoincluded.“Snowballsampling”by
searching reference lists and citation tracking was performed in each
retrieved article. No language restrictions were applied. If there were
queries regarding the methodology or results of the studies under
consideration, we attempted to contact the corresponding authors for
clarification.Followingsearchtermswereused:(“healthcareworkers”
OR“medicalstaff”OR“healthcareprofessionals”)AND(“coronavirus”
OR “SARS-COV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“depression” OR “anxiety”
OR “insomnia” OR“mental health” OR “psychological”).
The study population group consisted of healthcare workers (med-
ical and non-medical) in COVID-19 affected countries or areas. Only
studies evaluating the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and/or
insomnia using validated assessment methods were eligible for inclu-
sion.Broadtermssuchas‘psychologicaldistress’wereexcludedasthey
canbedifficulttoquantify;PTSDwasalsonotexcludedasitsonsetcan
be delayed.
2.2. Data extraction and quality assessment
Thefollowingdatawereextractedfromeacharticlebytworeviews
independently: study type, total number of participants, participation
rate,region,percentageofphysicians,nursesandotherHCWsscreened
in the survey, number of male and female participants, assessment
methods used and their cut-offs as well as the total number and per-
centageofparticipantsthatscreenedpositivefordepression,anxietyor
insomnia. If any of this information was not reported, the necessary
calculations (e.g. from percentage to number of HCWs) were done,
where possible. The accuracy of the extracted or calculated data was
confirmed bycomparing thecollectionforms ofthe twoinvestigators.
Inaddition,twoauthorsindependentlyevaluatedtheriskofbiasof
the included cross-sectional studies using a modified form of theNewcastle-Ottawa scale. Potential disagreements were resolved by a
third author. Quality assessment criteria were the following: sample
representativeness and size, comparability between respondents and
non-respondents, ascertainment of depression, anxiety and insomnia,and adequacy of descriptive statistics. Total quality score ranged be-tween0and5.Studiesscoring≥3pointswereregardedaslowriskof
bias, compared to the studies assessed with<3 points that were re-
garded ashigh riskofbias.
2.3. Data synthesis and analysis
Forthepurposesofthecurrentstudy,MetaXL(www.epigear.com),
an add-in for meta-analysis in Microsoft Excel for Windows was uti-
lized.Duetothefact,thatstudieswithprevalencecloseto0or1have
affectedvariancewhichmayleadtoalargeweightofthestudyinthe
meta-analysis, the proportions were transformed using the double
arcsine method and then back-transformed for ease of interpretation
(Barendregt et al., 2013). Due to the different patient populations, re-
gions, and assessment methods across studies, one true effect size
cannotbeassumed;therefore,arandomeffectsmodel(DerSimonian&
Laird) was used to extract the pooled prevalence. Substantial hetero-
geneity was defined as I
2> 75%. Subgroup analysis was done in the
following categories: gender, rating scales, severity of depression andanxiety and professional group. Sensitivity analysis was done by sub-
tracting each study and calculating the pooled prevalence of the re-
mainingstudies,inordertoidentifystudieswhichmayseverelyaffect
the pooled prevalence. Our main outcomes were prevalence (p), con-
fidence intervals(CI)and percentageprevalence (p× 100%).

3.1. Characteristics of included studies
Afterde-duplicationandscreening,thirteenstudies(Duetal.,2020;
Guoetal.,2020;Huangetal.,2020b;HuangandZhao,2020;Laietal.,
2020;Liuetal.,2020;Liuetal.,2020;Luetal.,2020;Qietal.,2020;
Tanetal.,2020;Zhangetal.,2020a,b;Zhuetal.,2020)withatotalof
33,062 participants were included in the analysis. All of the studies
were cross-sectional and reported on the prevalence of depression,
anxietyorinsomniaamongHCWduringtheCovid-19pandemic.Outof
the 13 studies, 12 were undertaken in China, two of which were in
Wuhan (Lai et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), while one took place in
Singapore (Tan et al., 2020). Median number of individuals per study
was 1563 (range 134, 11118) with a median male representation of
18% (281·5/1563) and a median questionnaire participation rate of
85·3% (range43·2%, 94·88%).
A summary of the characteristics of each study, including the
numberofparticipantsperstudy,participationrate,countryorregion,
HCWdistribution,maletofemaleratioandprevalenceofeachmental
health condition are provided in Table1. The Newcastle-Ottawa score
results for each study are shown in Table 2. The resulting pooled pre-
valence of anxiety, depression and insomnia as well as the subgroup
analyses are presented below. Notably, I

majorityoftheresults;ifI2wascloseto100%or0%twodecimalswere
used.
3.2. Anxiety prevalence
Anxiety was estimated in 12 studies (Du et al., 2020; Guo et al.,
2020;Huangetal.,2020b;HuangandZhao,2020;Laietal.,2020;Liu
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Zhang
et al., 2020a,b; Zhu et al., 2020). The pooled prevalence was 23·21%
(95% CI 17·77-29·13, I2= 99%) as presented in Fig. 2. In sensitivity
analysis, no study affected the pooled prevalence by over 2% when
excluded.Furthermore,lowriskofbiasstudies(n=9)revealedatotal
pooledanxietyprevalenceof24·06%(95%CI16·84-32·09,I2=99%).
Regarding assessment methods, four studies (Guo et al., 2020;S. Pappa, et al. Brain, Beha vior, and Immunity 88 (2020) 901–907

4. Discussion
A recent position paper in The Lancet (Holmes, 2020), called for
high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pan-
demic across the whole population and vulnerable groups such as
health careprofessionals.
Thistimelyrapidsystematicreview andmeta-analysesof13cross-
sectional studies and a total of 33,062 participants provides early evi-
dence that a high proportion of healthcare professionals experience
significantlevelsofanxiety,depressionandinsomniaduringCOVID-19
pandemic.Wearemindfulthatmentalhealthresearchintimesofcrisis,
such as COVID-19 outbreak, is a sensitive topic and would like to be-
lievethatallthestudiesincludedweregivendueethicalconsideration
(Townsend et al., 2020).
The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression (23·2% and 22·8%
respectively)ofHCWsduringCOVID-19arebroadlycomparabletothe
respectiverates,rangingbetween22·6%-36·3%foranxietyand16·5%-
48·3% for depression, reported for the general population in China
during the same period, which shows the considerable effect of the
crisis on the whole of the population (Wang et al., 2020; Gao et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020). Our results are also at the lower end of the
outcomespreviouslyreportedamongHCWsduringandaftertheMERS
andSARSepidemicswherehighratesofdepressionandanxietyaswell
as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury were ob-served(Lanceeetal.,2008;Tametal.,2004;Leeetal.,2018;Kohetal.,
2005).Potentialdifferences,however,betweentheseoutbreaksandthe
COVID-19 pandemic could be explained on the basis of the extremely
high infectious potential and mortality rate of the former but also the
experience acquired intheinterim inthese areas.
Although, the different scales and cut-off scores adopted by each
survey possibly introduced great between-study heterogeneity, it ap-
pears that the majority of the HCWs experienced mild symptoms both
fordepressionandanxiety,whilemoderateandseveresymptomswere
less common among the participants. In our view this emphasizes the
need for early detection and the importance of picking up and effec-
tively treating the milder clinical mood symptoms or sub-threshold
syndromes before they evolve to more complex and enduring psycho-
logical responses.
Furthermore, our sub-analysis revealed potentially important
genderandoccupationaldifferences.Theprevalencerateofanxietyand
depression appeared to be higher in females, which probably reflects
the already established gender gap for anxious and depressive symp-
toms (Albert, 2015). Again, nursing staff exhibited higher prevalence
estimates both for anxiety and depression compared to doctors. Theseresults may be partly confounded by the fact that nurses are mostlyfemalebutcouldbealsoattributedtothefacttheymayfaceagreater
risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients as they spend more time on
wards, provide direct care to patients and are responsible for the col-
lectionofsputumforvirusdetection(Liuetal.,2020).Moreover,dueto
their closer contact with patients they may be more exposed to moral
injury pertainingtosuffering, deathandethical dilemmas.
Although they were not suitable for inclusion in this review, a
number of other studies published in recent weeks provide emerging
evidence that COVID-19 is severely affecting the wellbeing of health-
careprofessionals.InHongKong,medicalandnursingstaffwerefound
vulnerable to burnout, anxiety and mental exhaustion (Cheung et al.,
2020) and in Germany doctors reported high levels of anxious and
depressive symptoms (Bohlken et al., 2020). Moreover, the psycholo-
gical impact of the crisis is not only felt by frontline respiratory and
intensive care physicians and nurses but also by HCW of other spe-
cialties including, for example, surgeons and anesthesiologists (Xu
et al., 2020). Sadly,there havebeen alsoreports ofsuicides, ashealth
care professionals are faced with accumulated psychological pressure
and intense fear of dying (Montemurro, 2020; Papoutsi et al., 2020);
thisisparticularlyalarminggiventhefactthatphysiciansarealreadyat
an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population (West
etal.,2018).AstudyexploringfactorsrelatedtoHCWs’psychological
difficulties found that infection of colleagues, infection of family
members, protective measures and medical violence (Dai et al., 2020;
Liuetal.,2020)wereamongthemainconcernsofHCWsinCOVID-19
affected areas. Unsurprisingly, level of social support was found to
positively correlate with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively
with anxiety andstress(Xiao etal., 2020).
To this end, early, targeted interventions should be considered. Of
relevance, another study performed in the original center of the epi-
demic,Wuhan,showedthatalargeproportionofHCWinWuhanwere
affected and that mental health support was necessary even for mildpsychological reactions (Kang et al., 2020). Indeed, much can be of-
feredinthecurrentcontext,suchasvirtualclinics,remotelydelivered
psychological therapies and psycho-education, chat lines, digital phe-
notyping and technologies monitoring risk. Finally, alongside infected
patients and HCWs, suspected cases, who are home isolated, and fa-
milies and friends of affected people have to be supported, too (The
Lancet Psychiatry, 2020).
Nevertheless,thereareseveralstrenghtsandkeylimitationstoour
review.Toourknowledge,thisisthefirstsystematicreviewandmeta-
analysis to examine the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and
insomnia on HCW during the COVID-19 outbreak. Although, the
numberofstudiesperseincludedinourmeta-analysiswasasexpected
inthe early stages ofthe pandemicstill relatively low, the majorityof
studiescomprisedaconsiderablenumberofparticipants.Furthermore,
our subgroup analysis of anxiety and depression based on gender,
professionalgroupandseverityprovidedadditionalvaluableinsightsof
potential particularvulnerabilities.
One major drawback that merits consideration is the inherent het-
erogeneity across studies. Different assessment scales were utilized for
population screening and different cut offs set even though several
studiesused thesame tests.Thus,thresholdcriteriaforcasedefinition
variedwithsomeinvestigatorsintentionallyusingmorelenientcriteria
inordertocapturemilderorsubsyndromalcases;henceoursubgroup
analysis by severity. Another limitation is that several studies might
haveincluded thesamepopulationasthey werebroadlyconductedin
the same region/country. Again, as the majority of studies were con-
ducted in China, the generalizability of our findings may be limited.
Having said that, generalizing this type of results could pose severe
flaws as healthcare systems vary greatly between countries.
Nevertheless, considering the fact that China was severely affected,
they provide a reliable indication of the potential of COVID-19 pan-
demic to affect the mental health of HCWs. Furthermore, the studies
included in our meta-analysis were all cross-sectional, thus the long-Table3
