Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of 
computer science that aims to create machines that can 
perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
AI includes various techniques such as machine learning 
(ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language process -
ing (NLP). Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type 
of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and 
massively large data sets to understand, summarize, gen -
erate, and predict new text-based content [ 1–3]. LLMs 
have been architected to generate text-based content 
and possess broad applicability for various NLP tasks, 
including text generation, translation, content summary, 
rewriting, classification, categorization, and sentiment 
analysis. NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the inter -
action between computers and humans through natural 
language, including understanding, interpreting, and 
generating human language. NLP involves various tech -
niques such as text mining, sentiment analysis, speech 
recognition, and machine translation. Over the years, 
AI has undergone significant transformations, from the 
early days of rule-based systems to the current era of ML 
and deep learning algorithms [ 1–3].
AI has evolved since the first AI program was devel -
oped in 1951 by Christopher Strachey. At that time, AI 
was in its infancy and was primarily an academic research topic. In 1956, John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth 
Conference, where he coined the term “ Artificial Intelli -
gence. “ This event marked the beginning of the modern 
AI era. In the 1960 and 1970  s, AI research focused on 
rule-based and expert systems. However, this approach 
was limited by the need for more computing power and 
data [ 4].
In the 1980 and 1990 s, AI research shifted to ML and 
neural networks, which allowed machines to learn from 
data and improve their performance over time. This 
period saw the development of systems such as IBM’s 
Deep Blue, which defeated world chess champion Garry 
Kasparov in 1997. In the 2000s, AI research continued to 
evolve, focusing on NLP and computer vision, which led 
to the development of virtual assistants, such as Apple’s 
Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, which could understand natural 
language and respond to user requests (Fig.  1) [3, 4].
Today, AI is transforming healthcare, finance, and 
transportation, among other fields, and its impact is only 
set to grow. In academia, AI has been used to develop 
intelligent tutoring systems, which are computer pro -
grams that can adapt to the needs of individual students. 
These systems have improved student learning out -
comes in various subjects, including math and science. 
In research, AI has been used to analyze large datasets 
and identify patterns that would be difficult for humans Keywords  AI, Healthcare, Patient care, Quality of life, Clinicians, Decision-making, Personalized treatment plans

to detect; this has led to breakthroughs in fields such as 
genomics and drug discovery. AI has been used in health -
care settings to develop diagnostic tools and personalized 
treatment plans. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial to 
ensure that it is developed responsibly and for the benefit 
of all [ 5–8].
The rapid progression of AI technology presents an 
opportunity for its application in clinical practice, poten -
tially revolutionizing healthcare services. It is impera -
tive to document and disseminate information regarding 
AI’s role in clinical practice, to equip healthcare provid -
ers with the knowledge and tools necessary for effective 
implementation in patient care. This review article aims 
to explore the current state of AI in healthcare, its poten -
tial benefits, limitations, and challenges, and to provide 
insights into its future development. By doing so, this 
review aims to contribute to a better understanding of 
AI’s role in healthcare and facilitate its integration into 
clinical practice.

AI assistance in diagnostics
Diagnosis accuracy
With all the advances in medicine, effective disease diag -
nosis is still considered a challenge on a global scale. 
The development of early diagnostic tools is an ongo -
ing challenge due to the complexity of the various dis -
ease mechanisms and the underlying symptoms. AI can 
revolutionize different aspects of health care, including diagnosis. ML is an area of AI that uses data as an input 
resource in which the accuracy is highly dependent on 
the quantity as well as the quality of the input data that 
can combat some of the challenges and complexity of 
diagnosis [ 9]. ML, in short, can assist in decision-making, 
manage workflow, and automate tasks in a timely and 
cost-effective manner. Also, deep learning added lay -
ers utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and 
data mining techniques that help identify data patterns. 
These are highly applicable in identifying key disease 
detection patterns among big datasets. These tools are 
highly applicable in healthcare systems for diagnosing, 
predicting, or classifying diseases [ 10].
AI is still in its early stages of being fully utilized for 
medical diagnosis. However, more data are emerging for 
the application of AI in diagnosing different diseases, 
such as cancer. A study was published in the UK where 
authors input a large dataset of mammograms into an AI 
system for breast cancer diagnosis. This study showed 
that utilizing an AI system to interpret mammograms 
had an absolute reduction in false positives and false neg -
atives by 5.7% and 9.4%, respectively [ 11]. Another study 
was conducted in South Korea, where authors compared 
AI diagnoses of breast cancer versus radiologists. The AI-
utilized diagnosis was more sensitive to diagnose breast 
cancer with mass compared to radiologists, 90% vs. 78%, 
respectively. Also, AI was better at detecting early breast 
cancer (91%) than radiologists 74% [ 12].
Furthermore, a study utilized deep learning to detect 
skin cancer which showed that an AI using CNN accu -
rately diagnosed melanoma cases compared to derma -
tologists and recommended treatment options [ 13, 14]. 
Researchers utilized AI technology in many other dis -
ease states, such as detecting diabetic retinopathy [ 15] 
and EKG abnormality and predicting risk factors for car -
diovascular diseases [ 16, 17]. Furthermore, deep learn -
ing algorithms are used to detect pneumonia from chest 
radiography with sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 
64% compared to radiologists 50% and 73%, respectively 
[18]. Also, a study was done on a dataset of 625 cases 
to diagnose acute appendicitis early to predict the need 
for appendix surgery using various ML techniques; the 
results showed that the random forest algorithm achieved 
the highest performance, accurately predicting appendi -
citis in 83.75% of cases, with a precision of 84.11%, sensi -
tivity of 81.08%, and specificity of 81.01%. The improved 
method aids healthcare specialists in making informed 
decisions for appendicitis diagnoses and treatment. Fur -
thermore, the authors suggest that similar techniques can 
be utilized to analyze images of patients with appendici -
tis or even to detect infections such as COVID-19 using 
blood specimens or images [ 19].
AI tools can improve accuracy, reduce costs, and 
save time compared to traditional diagnostic methods.

Additionally, AI can reduce the risk of human errors and 
provide more accurate results in less time. In the future, 
AI technology could be used to support medical deci -
sions by providing clinicians with real-time assistance 
and insights. Researchers continue exploring ways to use 
AI in medical diagnosis and treatment, such as analyzing 
medical images, X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. By leverag -
ing ML techniques, AI can also help identify abnormali -
ties, detect fractures, tumors, or other conditions, and 
provide quantitative measurements for faster and more 
accurate medical diagnosis.
Clinical laboratory testing provides critical informa -
tion for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring diseases. 
It is an essential part of modern healthcare which con -
tinuously incorporates new technology to support clini -
cal decision-making and patient safety [ 20]. AI has the 
potential to transform clinical laboratory testing by 
improving the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of labora -
tory processes. The role of AI in clinical microbiology is 
currently progressing and expanding. Several ML sys -
tems were developed to detect, identify, and quantify 
microorganisms, diagnose and classify diseases, and pre -
dict clinical outcomes. These ML systems used data from 
various sources to build the AI diagnosis such as genomic 
data of microorganisms, gene sequencing, metagenomic 
sequencing results of the original specimen, and micro -
scopic imaging [ 21]. Moreover, gram stain classification 
to gram positives/negatives and cocci/rods is another 
essential application of using deep convolutional neural 
networks that reveal high sensitivity and specificity [ 22]. 
A published systematic review showed that numerous 
MLs were evaluated for microorganism identification 
and antibiotic susceptibility testing; however, several lim -
itations are associated with the current models that must 
be addressed before incorporating them into clinical 
practice [ 23]. For malaria, Taesik et al. found that using 
ML algorithms combined with digital in-line holographic 
microscopy (DIHM) effectively detected malaria-infected 
red blood cells without staining. This AI technology is 
rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective in diagnosing malaria 
[24].
The projected benefits of using AI in clinical laborato -
ries include but are not limited to, increased efficacy and 
precision. Automated techniques in blood cultures, sus -
ceptibility testing, and molecular platforms have become 
standard in numerous laboratories globally, contributing 
significantly to laboratory efficiency [ 21, 25]. Automa -
tion and AI have substantially improved laboratory effi -
ciency in areas like blood cultures, susceptibility testing, 
and molecular platforms. This allows for a result within 
the first 24 to 48  h, facilitating the selection of suitable 
antibiotic treatment for patients with positive blood 
cultures [ 21, 26]. Consequently, incorporating AI in 
clinical microbiology laboratories can assist in choosing appropriate antibiotic treatment regimens, a critical fac -
tor in achieving high cure rates for various infectious dis -
eases [ 21, 26].
ML research in medicine has rapidly expanded, which 
could greatly help the healthcare providers in the emer -
gency department (ED) as they face challenging difficul -
ties from the rising burden of diseases, greater demand 
for time and health services, higher societal expectations, 
and increasing health expenditures [ 27]. Emergency 
department providers understand that integrating AI into 
their work processes is necessary for solving these prob -
lems by enhancing efficiency, and accuracy, and improv -
ing patient outcomes [ 28, 29]. Additionally, there may be 
a chance for algorithm support and automated decision-
making to optimize ED flow measurements and resource 
allocation [ 30]. AI algorithms can analyze patient data to 
assist with triaging patients based on urgency; this helps 
prioritize high-risk cases, reducing waiting times and 
improving patient flow [ 31]. Introducing a reliable symp -
tom assessment tool can rule out other causes of illness 
to reduce the number of unnecessary visits to the ED. A 
series of AI-enabled machines can directly question the 
patient, and a sufficient explanation is provided at the 
end to ensure appropriate assessment and plan.
Moreover, AI-powered decision support systems can 
provide real-time suggestions to healthcare providers, 
aiding diagnosis, and treatment decisions. Patients are 
evaluated in the ED with little information, and physi -
cians frequently must weigh probabilities when risk 
stratifying and making decisions. Faster clinical data 
interpretation is crucial in ED to classify the serious -
ness of the situation and the need for immediate inter -
vention. The risk of misdiagnosing patients is one of 
the most critical problems affecting medical practitio -
ners and healthcare systems. Diagnostic mistakes in the 
healthcare sector can be expensive and fatal. A study 
found that diagnostic errors, particularly in patients who 
visit the ED, directly contribute to a greater mortality 
rate and a more extended hospital stay [ 32]. Fortunately, 
AI can assist in the early detection of patients with life-
threatening diseases and promptly alert clinicians so the 
patients can receive immediate attention. Lastly, AI can 
help optimize health care sources in the ED by predicting 
patient demand, optimizing therapy selection (medica -
tion, dose, route of administration, and urgency of inter -
vention), and suggesting emergency department length 
of stay. By analyzing patient-specific data, AI systems can 
offer insights into optimal therapy selection, improving 
efficiency and reducing overcrowding.
AI in genomic medicine
The fusion of AI and genotype analysis holds immense 
promise in the realms of disease surveillance, prediction, 
and personalized medicine [ 33]. When applied to large 
--- Page 5 ---

Alowais et al. BMC Medical Education           (2023) 23:689 
populations, AI can effectively monitor for emerging dis -
ease threats (such as COVID-19), while genomic data can 
provide valuable insights into genetic markers associated 
with increased susceptibility to specific diseases [ 34] By 
training ML algorithms to identify these markers in real-
time data, we can facilitate the early detection of poten -
tial outbreaks. Moreover, the use of genotype data can 
aid in refining disease risk predictions, as ML algorithms 
can recognize complex patterns of genetic variations 
linked with disease susceptibility that might elude tra -
ditional statistical methods as summarized in Fig.  2 [35, 
36]. The prediction of phenotypes, or observable charac -
teristics shaped by genes and environmental factors, also 
becomes possible with this combination.
ML algorithms make it feasible to predict a spectrum 
of phenotypes ranging from simple traits like eye color 
to more intricate ones like the response to certain medi -
cations or disease susceptibility. A specific area where 
AI and ML have demonstrated significant efficacy is the 
identification of genetic variants associated with distinc -
tive traits or pathologies. Examining extensive genomic 
datasets allows these techniques to detect intricate pat -
terns often elusive to manual analysis. For instance, a 
groundbreaking study employed a deep neural network 
to identify genetic variants associated with autism spec -
trum disorder (ASD), successfully predicting ASD sta -
tus by relying solely on genomic data [ 37]. In the field 
of oncology, categorizing cancers into clinically relevant 
molecular subtypes can be accomplished using tran -
scriptomic profiling. Such molecular classifications, first 
developed for breast cancer and later extended to other 
cancers like colorectal, ovarian, and sarcomas, hold 
substantial implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and 
treatment selection [ 38, 39]. Traditional computational 
methods for subtyping cancers, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or k-nearest neighbors, are susceptible 
to errors due to batch effects and may only focus on a 
small set of signature genes, thus neglecting vital biologi -
cal information [ 40].
The advent of high-throughput genomic sequencing 
technologies, combined with advancements in AI and 
ML, has laid a strong foundation for accelerating per -
sonalized medicine and drug discovery [ 41]. Despite 
being a treasure trove of valuable insights, the complex 
nature of extensive genomic data presents substantial 
obstacles to its interpretation. The field of drug discov -
ery has dramatically benefited from the application of AI 
and ML. The simultaneous analysis of extensive genomic 
data and other clinical parameters, such as drug efficacy 
or adverse effects, facilitates the identification of novel 
therapeutic targets or the repurposing of existing drugs 
for new applications [ 42–46]. One of the prevalent chal -
lenges in drug development is non-clinical toxicity, which 
leads to a significant percentage of drug failures during 
clinical trials. However, the rise of computational model -
ing is opening up the feasibility of predicting drug tox -
icity, which can be instrumental in improving the drug 
development process [ 46]. This capability is particularly 
vital for addressing common types of drug toxicity, such 
as cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, which often lead to 
post-market withdrawal of drugs.
AI assistance in treatment
Precision medicine and clinical decision support
Personalized treatment, also known as precision medi -
cine or personalized medicine, is an approach that tailors 
medical care to individual patients based on their unique 
characteristics, such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, 
and biomarkers [ 47]. This individualized approach aims 
to improve patient outcomes by providing targeted

while the X-axis signifies the count of gene mutations. Negative numbers indicate gene deletions, whereas positive values represent gene additions or 
nucleic acid mutations

interventions that are more effective, efficient, and safe. 
AI has emerged as a valuable tool in advancing person -
alized treatment, offering the potential to analyze com -
plex datasets, predict outcomes, and optimize treatment 
strategies [ 47, 48]. Personalized treatment represents a 
pioneering field that demonstrates the potential of pre -
cision medicine on a large scale [ 49]. Nevertheless, the 
ability to provide real-time recommendations relies on 
the advancement of ML algorithms capable of predicting 
patients who may require specific medications based on 
genomic information. The key to tailoring medications 
and dosages to patients lies in the pre-emptive genotyp -
ing of patients prior to the actual need for such informa -
tion [ 49, 50].
The potential applications of AI in assisting clinicians 
with treatment decisions, particularly in predicting ther -
apy response, have gained recognition [ 49]. A study con -
ducted by Huang et al. where authors utilized patients’ 
gene expression data for training a support ML, suc -
cessfully predicted the response to chemotherapy [ 51]. 
In this study, the authors included 175 cancer patients 
incorporating their gene-expression profiles to predict 
the patients’ responses to various standard-of-care che -
motherapies. Notably, the research showed encouraging 
outcomes, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 80% 
across multiple drugs. These findings demonstrate the 
promising role of AI in treatment response prediction. 
In another study performed by Sheu et al., the authors 
aimed to predict the response to different classes of anti -
depressants using electronic health records (EHR) of 
17,556 patients and AI [ 52]. The AI models considered 
features predictive of treatment selection to minimize 
confounding factors and showed good prediction per -
formance. The study demonstrated that antidepressant 
response could be accurately predicted using real-world 
EHR data with AI modeling, suggesting the potential for 
developing clinical decision support systems for more 
effective treatment selection. While considerable prog -
ress has been made in leveraging AI techniques and 
genomics to forecast treatment outcomes, it is essential 
to conduct further prospective and retrospective clinical 
research and studies [ 47, 50]. These endeavors are nec -
essary for generating the comprehensive data required to 
train the algorithms effectively, ensure their reliability in 
real-world settings, and further develop AI-based clinical 
decision tools.
Dose optimization and therapeutic drug monitoring
AI plays a crucial role in dose optimization and adverse 
drug event prediction, offering significant benefits in 
enhancing patient safety and improving treatment out -
comes [ 53]. By leveraging AI algorithms, healthcare 
providers can optimize medication dosages tailored to 
individual patients and predict potential adverse drug events, thereby reducing risks and improving patient 
care. In a study that aimed to develop an AI-based pre -
diction model for prothrombin time international nor -
malized ratio (PT/INR) and a decision support system 
for warfarin maintenance dose optimization [ 54] The 
authors analyzed data from 19,719 inpatients across three 
institutions, and the algorithm outperformed expert phy -
sicians with significant differences in predicting future 
PT/INRs and the generated individualized warfarin dose 
was reliable.
On the contrary, a novel dose optimization system—
CURATE.AI—is an AI-derived platform for dynamically 
optimizing chemotherapy doses based on individual 
patient data [ 55]. A study was conducted to validate this 
system as an open-label, prospective trial in patients with 
advanced solid tumors treated with three different che -
motherapy regimens. CURATE.AI generated personal -
ized doses for subsequent cycles based on the correlation 
between chemotherapy dose variation and tumor marker 
readouts. The integration of CURATE.AI into the clinical 
workflow showed successful incorporation and potential 
benefits in terms of reducing chemotherapy dose and 
improving patient response rates and durations com -
pared to the standard of care. These findings support the 
need for prospective validation through randomized clin -
ical trials and indicate the potential of AI in optimizing 
chemotherapy dosing and lowering the risk of adverse 
drug events.
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a process used 
to optimize drug dosing in individual patients. It is pre -
dominantly utilized for drugs with a narrow therapeutic 
index to avoid both underdosing insufficiently medicating 
as well as toxic levels. TDM aims to ensure that patients 
receive the right drug, at the right dose, at the right time, 
to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome while mini -
mizing adverse effects [ 56]. The use of AI in TDM has 
the potential to revolutionize how drugs are monitored 
and prescribed. AI algorithms can be trained to predict 
an individual’s response to a given drug based on their 
genetic makeup, medical history, and other factors. This 
personalized approach to drug therapy can lead to more 
effective treatments and better patient outcomes [ 57, 58].
One example of AI in TDM is using ML algorithms to 
predict drug-drug interactions. By analyzing large datas -
ets of patient data, these algorithms can identify poten -
tial drug interactions. This can help to reduce the risk 
of adverse drug reactions, and cost and improve patient 
outcomes [ 59]. Another application of AI in TDM using 
predictive analytics to identify patients at high risk of 
developing adverse drug reactions. By analyzing patient 
data and identifying potential risk factors, healthcare 
providers can take proactive steps to prevent adverse 
events before they occur [ 60]. Overall, the use of AI in 
TDM has the potential to improve patient outcomes,

reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the accuracy and 
efficiency of drug dosing. As this technology continues to 
evolve, AI will likely play an increasingly important role 
in the field of TDM.
AI assistance in population health management
Predictive analytics and risk assessment
Population health management increasingly uses predic -
tive analytics to identify and guide health initiatives. In 
data analytics, predictive analytics is a discipline that sig -
nificantly utilizes modeling, data mining, AI, and ML. In 
order to anticipate the future, it analyzes historical and 
current data [ 61, 62]. ML algorithms and other technolo -
gies are used to analyze data and develop predictive mod -
els to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. One 
area where predictive analytics can be instrumental is in 
identifying patients at risk of developing chronic diseases 
such as endocrine or cardiac diseases. By analyzing data 
such as medical history, demographics, and lifestyle fac -
tors, predictive models can identify patients at higher 
risk of developing these conditions and target interven -
tions to prevent or treat them [ 61]. Predicting hospital 
readmissions is another area where predictive analytics 
can be applied. By analyzing patient demographics, med -
ical history, and social health factors, predictive models 
can identify patients at higher risk of hospital readmis -
sions and target interventions to prevent readmissions 
(Fig.  3) [62–64]; this can help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes which is the reason behind 
launching new companies such as “Reveal ®” [ 65].
AI can be used to optimize healthcare by improv -
ing the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models. AI 
algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and iden -
tify patterns and relationships that may not be obvious 
to human analysts; this can help improve the accuracy 
of predictive models and ensure that patients receive the 
most appropriate interventions. AI can also automate 
specific public health management tasks, such as patient 
outreach and care coordination [ 61, 62]. Which can help 
reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
by ensuring patients receive timely and appropriate care. 
However, it is pivotal to note that the success of predic -
tive analytics in public health management depends 
on the quality of data and the technological infrastruc -
ture used to develop and implement predictive models. 
In addition, human supervision is vital to ensure the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of interventions for at-
risk patients. In summary, predictive analytics plays an 
increasingly important role in population health. Using 
ML algorithms and other technologies, healthcare orga -
nizations can develop predictive models that identify 
patients at risk for chronic disease or readmission to the 
hospital [ 61–64].
Furthermore, AI is needed to address these challenges 
regarding vaccine production and supply chain bottle -
necks. Testing algorithms on real-time vaccine supply

chains can be challenging. To overcome this, investing 
in research and development is essential to create robust 
algorithms that can accurately predict and optimize vac -
cine supply chains. Edge analytics can also detect anoma -
lies and predict Disease X events and associated risks to 
the healthcare system [ 66].
From a Saudi perspective, Sehaa, a big data analytics 
tool in Saudi Arabia, uses Twitter data to detect diseases, 
and it found that dermal diseases, heart diseases, hyper -
tension, cancer, and diabetes are the top five diseases in 
the country [ 67]. Riyadh has the highest awareness-to-
afflicted ratio for six of the fourteen diseases detected, 
while Taif is the healthiest city with the lowest number of 
disease cases and a high number of awareness activities. 
These findings highlight the potential of predictive ana -
lytics in population health management and the need for 
targeted interventions to prevent and treat chronic dis -
eases in Saudi Arabia [ 67]. AI can optimize health care by 
improving the accuracy and efficiency of predictive mod -
els and automating certain tasks in population health 
management [ 62]. However, successfully implementing 
predictive analytics requires high-quality data, advanced 
technology, and human oversight to ensure appropriate 
and effective interventions for patients.
Establishment of working groups, guidelines, and 
frameworks
AI is transforming how guidelines are established in vari -
ous fields. In healthcare, guidelines usually take much 
time, from establishing the knowledge gap that needs to 
be fulfilled to publishing and disseminating these guide -
lines. AI can help identify newly published data based on 
data from clinical trials and real-world patient outcomes 
within the same area of interest which can then facili -
tate the first stage of mining information. Then, under 
the supervision of scientists and experts in the field, AI 
algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify 
patterns and trends that can inform the development of 
evidence-based guidelines in real-time, which allows for 
a fast exchange of information with essential supervision 
clinicians for its clinical and ethical implications [ 68–73].
Several professional organizations have developed 
frameworks for addressing concerns unique to develop -
ing, reporting, and validating AI in medicine [ 69–73]. 
Instead of focusing on the clinical application of AI, 
these frameworks are more concerned with educating 
the technological creators of AI by providing instruc -
tions on encouraging transparency in the design and 
reporting of AI algorithms [ 69]. Additionally, regulatory 
regulation of AI is still in its infancy. The US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) is now developing guide -
lines on critically assessing real-world applications of AI 
in medicine while publishing a framework to guide the 
role of AI and ML in software as medical devices [ 74]. The European Commission has spearheaded a multidis -
ciplinary effort to improve the credibility of AI [ 75], and 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has deemed 
the regulation of AI a strategic priority [ 76]. These leg -
islative efforts are meant to shape the healthcare future 
to be better equipped to be a technology-driven sector. 
Overall, the role of AI in establishing guidelines is to pro -
vide data-driven insights and recommendations based 
on vast amounts of information, which can lead to more 
efficient and effective decision-making, better outcomes, 
and reduced costs. However, it is crucial to ensure that 
AI-based guidelines are transparent, fair, unbiased, and 
informed by human expertise and ethical considerations 
[68].
AI in drug information and consultation
AI would propose a new support system to assist prac -
tical decision-making tools for healthcare providers. 
In recent years, healthcare institutions have provided 
a greater leveraging capacity of utilizing automation-
enabled technologies to boost workflow effectiveness and 
reduce costs while promoting patient safety, accuracy, 
and efficiency [ 77]. By introducing advanced technolo -
gies like NLP , ML, and data analytics, AI can significantly 
provide real-time, accurate, and up-to-date informa -
tion for practitioners at the hospital. According to the 
McKinsey Global Institute, ML and AI in the pharma -
ceutical sector have the potential to contribute approxi -
mately $100 billion annually to the US healthcare system 
[78]. Researchers claim that these technologies enhance 
decision-making, maximize creativity, increase the effec -
tiveness of research and clinical trials, and produce new 
tools that benefit healthcare providers, patients, insurers, 
and regulators [ 78]. AI enables quick and comprehen -
sive retrieval of drug-related information from differ -
ent resources through its ability to analyze the current 
medical literature, drug databases, and clinical guidelines 
to provide accurate and evidence-based decisions for 
healthcare providers. Using automated response systems, 
AI-powered virtual assistants can handle common ques -
tions and provide detailed medical information to health -
care providers [ 79]. AI-powered chatbots help reduce the 
workload on healthcare providers, allowing them to focus 
on more complicated cases that require their expertise. 
Also, AI algorithms can generate specific recommen -
dations for individual patients, considering factors like 
health conditions, past medical and medication history, 
and social/lifestyle preferences, allowing healthcare pro -
fessionals to optimize medication choices and dosages 
[80, 81].

AI-powered patient care
AI virtual healthcare assistance
With continuously increasing demands of health care 
services and limited resources worldwide, finding solu -
tions to overcome these challenges is essential [ 82]. 
Virtual health assistants are a new and innovative tech -
nology transforming the healthcare industry to sup -
port healthcare professionals. It is designed to simulate 
human conversation to offer personalized patient care 
based on input from the patient [ 83]. These digital assis -
tants use AI-powered applications, chatbots, sounds, and 
interfaces. Virtual assistants can help patients with tasks 
such as identifying the underlying problem based on the 
patient’s symptoms, providing medical advice, remind -
ing patients to take their medications, scheduling doctor 
appointments, and monitoring vital signs. In addition, 
digital assistants can collect information daily regarding 
patients’ health and forward the reports to the assigned 
physician. By taking off some of these responsibilities 
from human healthcare providers, virtual assistants 
can help to reduce their workload and improve patient 
outcomes.
Furthermore, these tools can always be available, 
making it easier for patients to access healthcare when 
needed [ 84]. Another medical service that an AI-driven 
phone application can provide is triaging patients and 
finding out how urgent their problem is, based on the 
entered symptoms into the app. The National Health 
Service (NHS) has tested this app in north London, and 
now about 1.2 million people are using this AI chatbot to 
answer their questions instead of calling the NHS non-
emergency number [ 85]. In addition, introducing intel -
ligent speakers into the market has a significant benefit 
in the lives of elderly and chronically ill patients who are 
unable to use smartphone apps efficiently [ 86]. Overall, 
virtual health assistants have the potential to significantly 
improve the quality, efficiency, and cost of healthcare 
delivery while also increasing patient engagement and 
providing a better experience for them.
AI mental health support
AI has the potential to revolutionize mental health sup -
port by providing personalized and accessible care to 
individuals [ 87, 88]. Several studies showed the effec -
tiveness and accessibility of using Web-based or Inter -
net-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as a 
psychotherapeutic intervention [ 89, 90]. Even though 
psychiatric practitioners rely on direct interaction and 
behavioral observation of the patient in clinical prac -
tice compared to other practitioners, AI-powered tools 
can supplement their work in several ways. AI-powered 
mental health applications can assist in the early detec -
tion and diagnosis of mental health conditions, as well 
as provide tailored treatment and support [ 88–91] These applications can also offer round-the-clock sup -
port, reducing the need for in-person appointments and 
wait times. Furthermore, these digital tools can be used 
to monitor patient progress and medication adherence, 
providing valuable insights into treatments’ effectiveness 
[88].
The current published studies addressing the appli -
cability of AI in mental health concluded that depres -
sion is the most commonly investigated mental disorder 
[88]. Moreover, AI-powered apps prove their benefits 
in patients with substance use disorder. A recent study 
evaluated the utility of a mental health digital app called 
Woebot in patients with substance use disorders. This 
study found that using Woebot was significantly associ -
ated with improved substance use, cravings, depression, 
and anxiety [ 92]. While AI-powered mental health diag -
nosis holds promise, some significant limitations must be 
addressed. One of the main limitations is the risk of bias 
in the data and algorithms used in AI-powered diagnosis. 
If the data used to train AI algorithms does not represent 
diverse populations, it can lead to biased and inaccurate 
results. Additionally, AI-powered diagnosis may not take 
into account the complexity of mental health conditions, 
which can present differently in different people. Finally, 
there is a risk that AI-powered diagnosis may lead to a 
lack of personalization and empathy in mental health 
care, which is an important aspect of successful treat -
ment [ 93]. Therefore, while AI-powered diagnosis can be 
a valuable tool in mental health care, it should be used 
as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, profes -
sional diagnosis and treatment.
AI in enhancing patient education and mitigating 
healthcare provider burnout
One of the emerging applications of AI is patient educa -
tion [ 94]. AI-powered chatbots are being implemented 
in various healthcare contexts, such as diet recom -
mendations [ 95, 96], smoking cessation, and cognitive-
behavioral therapy [ 97]. Patient education is integral to 
healthcare, as it enables individuals to understand their 
medical diagnosis, treatment options, and preventa -
tive measures [ 98]. Informed patients are more likely to 
adhere to their treatment regimens and achieve better 
health outcomes [ 99]. AI has the potential to play a sig -
nificant role in patient education by providing personal -
ized and interactive information and guidance to patients 
and their caregivers [ 100]. For example, in patients with 
prostate cancer, introducing a prostate cancer com -
munication assistant (PROSCA) chatbot offered a clear 
to moderate increase in participants’ knowledge about 
prostate cancer [ 101]. Researchers found that ChatGPT, 
an AI Chatbot founded by OpenAI, can help patients 
with diabetes understand their diagnosis and treatment 
options, monitor their symptoms and adherence, provide 
--- Page 10 ---
Page 10 of 15
Alowais et al. BMC Medical Education           (2023) 23:689 
feedback and encouragement, and answer their ques -
tions [ 102]. AI technology can also be applied to rewrite 
patient education materials into different reading lev -
els. This suggests that AI can empower patients to take 
greater control of their health by ensuring that patients 
can understand their diagnosis, treatment options, and 
self-care instructions [ 103]. However, there are also some 
challenges and limitations that need to be addressed, 
such as ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and transpar -
ency of the information provided by AI, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality of the patients’ data, and 
maintaining a human touch and empathy in the commu -
nication [ 104]. The use of AI in patient education is still 
in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize 
the way that patients learn about their health. As AI tech -
nology continues to develop, we can expect to see even 
more innovative and effective ways to use AI to educate 
patients.
Are individuals more inclined towards AI than human 
healthcare providers
Public perception of the benefits and risks of AI in 
healthcare systems is a crucial factor in determining 
its adoption and integration. People’s feelings about AI 
replacing or augmenting human healthcare practitio -
ners, its role in educating and empowering patients, and 
its impact on the quality and efficiency of care, as well as 
on the well-being of healthcare workers, are all important 
considerations. In medicine, patients often trust medical 
staff unconditionally and believe that their illness will be 
cured due to a medical phenomenon known as the pla -
cebo effect. In other words, patient-physician trust is vital 
in improving patient care and the effectiveness of their 
treatment [ 105]. For the relationship between patients 
and an AI-based healthcare delivery system to succeed, 
building a relationship based on trust is imperative [ 106].
Research on whether people prefer AI over healthcare 
practitioners has shown mixed results depending on the 
context, type of AI system, and participants’ characteris -
tics [ 107, 108]. Some surveys have indicated that people 
are generally willing to use or interact with AI for health-
related purposes such as diagnosis, treatment, moni -
toring, or decision support [ 108–110]. However, other 
studies have suggested that people still prefer human 
healthcare practitioners over AI, especially for complex 
or sensitive issues such as mental health, chronic dis -
eases, or end-of-life care [ 108, 111]. In a US-based study, 
60% of participants expressed discomfort with providers 
relying on AI for their medical care. However, the same 
study found that 80% of Americans would be willing to 
use AI-powered tools to help manage their health [ 109]. 
In another survey, responders’ comfort with AI varied 
based on clinical application, and most patients felt that 
AI would improve their healthcare, which suggests that people are generally willing to use AI for healthcare-
related purposes and that patient education, concerns, 
and comfort levels should be accounted for when plan -
ning for integration of AI [ 110]. Moreover, people’s trust 
and acceptance of AI may vary depending on their age, 
gender, education level, cultural background, and previ -
ous experience with technology [ 111, 112].
Future directions and considerations for clinical 
implementation
Obstacles and solutions
AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical practice, but 
several challenges must be addressed to realize its full 
potential. Among these challenges is the lack of quality 
medical data, which can lead to inaccurate outcomes. 
Data privacy, availability, and security are also potential 
limitations to applying AI in clinical practice. Addition -
ally, determining relevant clinical metrics and selecting 
an appropriate methodology is crucial to achieving the 
desired outcomes. Human contribution to the design 
and application of AI tools is subject to bias and could 
be amplified by AI if not closely monitored [ 113]. The 
AI-generated data and/or analysis could be realistic 
and convincing; however, hallucination could also be a 
major issue which is the tendency to fabricate and cre -
ate false information that cannot be supported by exist -
ing evidence [ 114]. This can be particularly problematic 
regarding sensitive areas such as patient care. Thus, the 
development of AI tools has implications for current 
health professions education, highlighting the necessity 
of recognizing human fallibility in areas including clini -
cal reasoning and evidence-based medicine [ 115]. Finally, 
human expertise and involvement are essential to ensure 
the appropriate and practical application of AI to meet 
clinical needs and the lack of this expertise could be a 
drawback for the practical application of AI.
Addressing these challenges and providing construc -
tive solutions will require a multidisciplinary approach, 
innovative data annotation methods, and the develop -
ment of more rigorous AI techniques and models. Cre -
ating practical, usable, and successfully implemented 
technology would be possible by ensuring appropriate 
cooperation between computer scientists and healthcare 
providers. By merging current best practices for ethical 
inclusivity, software development, implementation sci -
ence, and human-computer interaction, the AI commu -
nity will have the opportunity to create an integrated best 
practice framework for implementation and maintenance 
[116]. Additionally, a collaboration between multiple 
health care settings is required to share data and ensure 
its quality, as well as verify analyzed outcomes which 
will be critical to the success of AI in clinical practice. 
Another suggestion is to provide appropriate training 
and education that starts from the undergraduate level of 
--- Page 11 ---

Alowais et al. BMC Medical Education           (2023) 23:689 
all the health care practitioners and proceeds to the con -
tinuous development and improvement for the practitio -
ners working in the current practice to ensure the proper 
adaptation which provides the best patient care and avoid 
any legal or ethical issues or misinterpretation of the 
outcomes without verifying the results [ 117]. Medical 
schools are encouraged to incorporate AI-related topics 
into their medical curricula. A study conducted among 
radiology residents showed that 86% of students agreed 
that AI would change and improve their practice, and up 
to 71% felt that AI should be taught at medical schools 
for better understanding and application [ 118]. This 
integration ensures that future healthcare professionals 
receive foundational knowledge about AI and its applica -
tions from the early stages of their education.
Legal, ethical, and risk associated with AI in healthcare 
system
Converting AI and big data into secure and efficient prac -
tical applications, services, and procedures in healthcare 
involves significant costs and risks. Consequently, safe -
guarding the commercial interests of AI and data-driven 
healthcare technologies has emerged as an increasingly 
crucial subject [ 119]. In the past, only medical profes -
sionals could measure vital signs such as blood pressure, 
glucose levels, and heart rate [ 48]. However, contem -
porary mobile applications now enable the continuous 
collection of such information. Nevertheless, address -
ing the ethical risks associated with AI implementation 
is imperative, particularly concerning data privacy and 
confidentiality violations, informed consent, and patient 
autonomy [ 48, 119]. Given the prominence of big data 
and AI in healthcare and precision medicine, robust data 
protection legislation becomes paramount to safeguard -
ing individual privacy. Countries around the world have 
introduced laws to protect the privacy of their citizens, 
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Account -
ability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe [ 120, 121]. 
While HIPAA protects only relevant health informa -
tion produced by covered entities, the GDPR has imple -
mented extensive data protection law within the EU, 
creating a significant global shift in data protection [ 120, 
121].
One of the major causes that can compromise patient 
data, disrupt critical healthcare operations, and jeopar -
dize patient safety with the use of AI in the healthcare 
system is increased cyberattacks [ 66, 122]. Predictive 
algorithms can be employed to detect and prevent these 
cyber threats. To safeguard data privacy and maintain 
system integrity, it’s essential to deeply investigate cyber -
security and the cyber risk landscape of healthcare sys -
tems [ 66, 123]. By implementing a variety of robust AI 
algorithms, the risk associated with relying on a singular solution can be mitigated [ 66, 123]. While data privacy 
and security breaches are challenges associated with 
AI in healthcare [ 122], it offers significant advantages 
such as task streamlining, enhanced efficiency, time and 
resource savings, research support, and reduced physi -
cian stress [ 122]. In the context of ethical considerations, 
an epistemological framework for ethical assessment has 
been proposed to prioritize ethical awareness, transpar -
ency, and accountability when evaluating digital tech -
nology’s impact on healthcare supply chain participants 
[123, 124].
Conclusion
The integration of AI in healthcare has immense poten -
tial to revolutionize patient care and outcomes. AI-driven 
predictive analytics can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, 
and cost-effectiveness of disease diagnosis and clinical 
laboratory testing. Additionally, AI can aid in population 
health management and guideline establishment, pro -
viding real-time, accurate information and optimizing 
medication choices. Integrating AI in virtual health and 
mental health support has shown promise in improving 
patient care. However, it is important to address limita -
tions such as bias and lack of personalization to ensure 
equitable and effective use of AI.
Several measures must be taken to ensure responsible 
and effective implementation of AI in healthcare.
Firstly, comprehensive cybersecurity strategies and 
robust security measures should be developed and imple -
mented to protect patient data and critical healthcare 
operations. Collaboration between healthcare organiza -
tions, AI researchers, and regulatory bodies is crucial to 
establishing guidelines and standards for AI algorithms 
and their use in clinical decision-making. Investment in 
research and development is also necessary to advance 
AI technologies tailored to address healthcare challenges.
AI algorithms can continuously examine factors such 
as population demographics, disease prevalence, and 
geographical distribution. This can identify patients at 
a higher risk of certain conditions, aiding in prevention 
or treatment. Edge analytics can also detect irregulari -
ties and predict potential healthcare events, ensuring that 
resources like vaccines are available where most needed.
Public perception of AI in healthcare varies, with 
individuals expressing willingness to use AI for health 
purposes while still preferring human practitioners in 
complex issues. Trust-building and patient education are 
crucial for the successful integration of AI in healthcare 
practice. Overcoming challenges like data quality, pri -
vacy, bias, and the need for human expertise is essential 
for responsible and effective AI integration.
Collaboration among stakeholders is vital for robust 
AI systems, ethical guidelines, and patient and pro -
vider trust. Continued research, innovation, and

interdisciplinary collaboration are important to unlock 
the full potential of AI in healthcare. With successful 
integration, AI is anticipated to revolutionize healthcare, 
leading to improved patient outcomes, enhanced effi -
ciency, and better access to personalized treatment and 
quality care.
